## Background

Boom Buddies is a strategic initiative at the intersection of entertainment, technology, and business scalability. Its value proposition includes:

1. **Access to underserved markets**: By removing technical barriers, Boom Buddies reaches millions of players excluded from mainstream multiplayer experiences.
2. **Scalable monetization**: The game leverages integrated ads and optional subscriptions.
3. **Modern cloud-ready architecture**: Built on Unity, Svelte, ASP.NET, Redis, MySQL, and Azure, ensuring high performance, low latency, and seamless scalability.

Unity serves as the core engine, enabling WebGL deployment, cross-platform scalability, and integration with Unity Relay and UnityNeuroSpeech services for dynamic multiplayer lobbies and real-time narration.
